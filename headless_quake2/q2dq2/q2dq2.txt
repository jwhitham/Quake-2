(1) Introduction

(1.1) What's Quake2 done Quick2?

Quake2 done Quick2 (known as Q2dQ2 for short) is the first speed-run
by the Quake done Quick team through id Software's Quake2. It is a run
all the way through Quake2 on Hard skill, going through the levels as
fast as possible.

We do not worry about secrets and kills, only about completing the
primary game goals as specified in the manual and completing the game.

We didn't use bunny-hops (strafe-jumping) except to perform tricks
that couldn't be done in any other way.

The run is continuous, so that we begin each new level with the same
statistics with which we ended the previous level. In cases where we
return to a level we have already visited, the level starts in the
same state as when we left it previously. The run should therefore be
just like a single continuous run through the game, although like all
QdQ runs, it was actually recorded one level at a time.

We do not expect every demo to be completely optimised, some maps
certainly still have some room for improvements - the only certainty
in speed-running is that you can always do it faster somehow. (-:
If you think you can beat any of the demos in Q2dQ2, please get in
touch and we'll supply you with the technology needed to record a demo
that will fit into the existing run.


(2) The run

(2.1) Installation

(At the time of release, Q2dQ2 works for WinXX platforms only. Check the
download page for extra information on Linux and Mac versions.)

First you need to find your main Quake2 directory. This probably has
the name "Quake2" and will contain such items as your Quake2 executable
program (quake2.exe) and your baseq2 game subdirectory.

You should make a subdirectory of this main directory. Give it
whatever name you like; for the purposes of these instructions we will
assume you have called it "Q2dQ2". You can e.g. do this in a DOS shell
by changing to your main Quake2 directory and then typing "md Q2dQ2" at
the prompt.

You should unzip the contents of q2dq2.zip into your Q2dQ2 directory.


(2.2) Running and viewing

First, you will need the "official" version of Quake2, v3.20, in order
to watch the demos. If you aren't up-to-date, you can download what you
need from many places, including <http://planetquake.com/files/>

Now to watch the run, start Quake2 with the command-line option "+game
q2dq2". Alternatively, you can start Quake2 as normal and then enter
"game q2dq2" in the console.

The run is played from a menu interface, so that you can choose to
play the whole speed-run, or individual units, or individual runs.
Use the same keys that you use to access the Quake2 inventory menu
to move around and make selections in the menu. By default, these
will be the "[" and "]" keys to move up and down, and the "ENTER"
key to select a menu item.

If you have them available, you can toggle the inclusion of the
original id cinematics as part of playback with a menu option.

Whilst playing a demo, you can press F10 to stop and return
to the menu.

Note that if you press non-function keys in Quake2 whilst a
demo is playing, this will take you to the console. To return
to the main Q2dQ2 menu, you can press F10, or enter "menu" as
a console command.

If you are a keen player who has optimised their DeathMatch framerate
at the expense of viewing quality, you may wish to choose some
different configuration options to play back this run so that it looks
as pretty as possible. A good way to do this is to edit the
q2dq2/autoexec.cfg file. 

Is there anything else you need to know? Sorry, we'll have to blank
you - there are no Easter Egg demos in the Q2dQ2 speed-run. There
will be plenty of eggs when we make a proper movie, though.

We don't know about any playback problems in Q2dQ2, but since this
is the first time we have released something for Quake2, it is
possible that some exist. Please write and tell us if you find any
problems, so that we can fix them, and do things better next time.

As time goes on, FAQs about this release will no doubt arise.
We will try to publish answers to the common ones on our website.
When we do this, these will be available via the download page at
<http://PlanetQuake.com/QdQ/Q2dQ2.html>.


(3) More details about the run

(3.1) Timing

Just a quick explanation of why we say we completed Quake2 in 21:06.

We recorded every demo separately and then connected them together,
adding up the times for each level.

The times for individual levels are rounded down to a whole number
of seconds, ignoring any fractions of a second. This convention is
inherited from Quake1 speed-running; consistency was our main
concern. The total time for our run if the excess fractions of a
second are taken into account is 21:38.3.


(3.2) How the run was recorded

We recorded each demo separately, on skill 2 (Hard), of course without
any cheating. To time the demos, and to start with the correct stats
and entity positions that we ended the previous levels with, we used
some specially written recording options in a game modification by
Nolan Pflug called q2timer.

We recorded Quake2 as one big run because Quake2 was made to be played
all the way through, and not as separate levels. We did it by
connecting single demos together because the final product is a lot
more interesting and entertaining that way, and we could include some
very cool tricks that we couldn't do had we recorded it in one sitting.

However we wanted to be sure that the finished run worked just like a
single continuous playing session, and have worked hard on our recording
technology in order to do this. The "hub" system of levels that allows
the player to carry items between levels and re-enter levels that they
have already visited meant this was much harder to do in Quake2 than in
Quake1. If you find any continuity problems, please let us know about
them.

The details of the recording procedure are too complicated to explain
here, but in time we intend to publish them on our website.
When we do this, these will be available via the download page at
<http://PlanetQuake.com/QdQ/Q2dQ2.html>.

(3.3) The bunny-hop restriction

In Quake2, a player can increase their speed with various techniques
that are based on swiftly changing direction in combination with
jumping. The main trick is commonly known as turbo-running, although
QdQ tend to refer to it as bunny-hopping because of the similarity to
the Quake1 technique of the same name. It basically reduces to
repeatedly jumping whilst strafing and turning a little.

To proceed through Quake2 as quickly as possible, a player needs
to bunny-hop non-stop. Some people, including several of the Q2dQ2
team members, find the results unattractive. There was also a concern
that the effectiveness of the technique is frame-rate dependent, which
would have meant that in order to get the best times, a player had to
have as fast a computer system as possible. This would have introduced
undesirable unfairness to speed-running.

For this first Q2dQ2 run, we decided to restrict the use of bunny-hopping.
We bunny-hop only when it is necessary for us to do so in order to perform
some trick (more precisely, to follow a particular route through the
Quake2 environment at a certain cost of damage.) This is an arbitrary
restriction that results in slower than optimum times, but we thought
it was appropriate for this first attempt at a Quake2 speed-run.

Perhaps future QdQ runs through Quake2 will feature unrestricted
bunny-hops. This development would echo that of Quake1 speed-running,
where bunny-hops became more important as time progressed and running
techniques were refined.


(3.4) Project overview

Quake done Quick started making these sort of runs using Quake1 a couple
of years ago. There are plenty of downloads waiting for you at
<http://planetquake.com/qdq/> if you haven't seen them already.

This was our first project for Quake2, and it took a very long time to
complete - sorry to the people who have been waiting impatiently! The
details of speed-running Quake2 turn out to be much more complicated than
they were in Quake1.

A lot of new recording technology had to be written, and tuning the details
so that everything worked right took us a long time. I'd like especially to
thank Nolan Pflug and Will Marsh for their efforts in making everything work
as it should. Respect also to all the runners for putting up with all the
patches, fixes and work-arounds that we had to use whilst trying to get
things working, and to Gerald Tangent for assembling and motivating the team.

Quake2 underwent many changes relevant to gameplay post-release. We waited
for the game to stabilise (and for the baseq2 source to be released) before
starting recording on this project, since we wanted to run a single, stable
version of the game.

In both the above cases, we could have cut our losses, accepted that the
finished product wouldn't really represent a continuous run through the game,
and released something that wasn't quite right. It would probably have been
just as enjoyable to watch a run where the details don't quite work, but we
didn't want to compromise the integrity of our speed-runs, so we accepted the
delay resulting from getting the details right.

But although there are devils in those details, there is lots new to enjoy
about running this game as well.

Quake2 adds many jumping tricks to the ammunition available to runners.
Double-jumping and other varieties of ledge pull-ups were probably as
important as grenade and rocket-jumping in this run, but there are others too,
including the occasional "permitted" bunnies and circle-jumps.

The ability to carry items between maps (especially with skill 2's "only
one of any power-up at a time" restriction) adds a lot to the strategy
involved in route planning. There was a lot of discussion about which
Quads and Invulnerabilities would yield a profit over all.

The hub/unit-system makes keys and triggers interesting too. There are
actually a few places where one can carry keys between units; for example,
one could avoid using the blue key in waste3 and take it through to use in
lab.

However that minor saving was abandonned when we found a forgotten
floating trigger that let us avoid most of the Power unit altogether;
this is probably my favourite hack in the run. Other neat tricks are the
corpse and bullet door-stops in ware1 and ware2, the 10fps laser bug in
jail3, the supertank launch in jail4, the rocket+grenade in mine1, the
adrenaline grab in mine3iii, the Quad from water in hangar2, the
well-known window in the black hole generator's security in command,
and the icarus and beserker assists in city1 and city2ii.

Enjoy the run! Especially, ah, hangar1ii...

timing runs, allowing recordings to follow-on from previous runs,
and logging information needed for other demo processing.

D2relise by Will Marsh (unreleased) in order to maintain continuity
of the later demos when improvements were made to earlier demos in
the run.

LMPC by Uwe Girlich <http://PlanetQuake.com/demospecs/> for
decompiling & recompiling demos so we could use the convenient LS format.
Also Uwe's DM2 specs were very useful for us in creating our own tools.

Dm2Tool by Stefan Schwoon <http://PlanetQuake.com/QdQ/Dm2Tool.html>.
A variety of other tools also made use of his skeleton code for
